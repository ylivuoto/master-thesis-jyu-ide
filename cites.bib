Here, we use two approaches: feedback based on stack trace analysis, and feedback based on structural comparisons of a learner program and appropriate sample programs. In order to investigate both approaches, we developed two prototypical extensions for the Eclipse IDE. In a laboratory study, we empirically evaluated the impact of the extensions on learners' performance while they solved programming tasks. The statistical analyses did not reveal any statistically significant effects of the prototype extensions on the performance of the learners, however, the results of a qualitative analysis imply that the provided feedback had at least a marginal impact on the performance of some learners. Also, feedback from the participants confirmed the benefit of providing feedback directly within IDEs.",

  abstract      = {Students often spend a considerable amount of time and effort installing and configuring programming tools and environments. This can frustrate, and distract them from more important learning objectives, particularly in introductory programming courses. A web-based integrated development environment can serve as a low-threshold, ready-to-use programming environment, and reduce the time and effort needed to start practicing programming.In this paper, we report our experience of developing and deploying a web-based integrated development environment (web IDE) as an optional tool at a large public university that has been in use for over several years in various programming courses.We conducted a survey to understand students' perceptions toward the web IDE and usage of its features. Using the data from the survey, we explored potential correlations between student demographic and behavioral traits in adoption of the web IDE. The results of the survey suggest that around half of the students use the IDE often or very often. We also discovered that the likelihood of adoption of the IDE decreases as students to move to upper classes. In this paper, we also describe broader lessons for educators and researchers.},

  abstract      = {CS Education makes heavy use of online educational tools like IDEs, Learning Management Systems, eTextbooks, interactive programming environments, and other smart content. Instructors and students would benefit from greater interoperability between tools. CS Ed researchers increasingly make use of the large collections of data generated by click streams coming from them. However, we all face barriers that slow progress: (1) Educational tools do not integrate well. (2) Information about CS learning process and outcome data generated by one system is not compatible with that from other systems. (3) CS problem solving and learning (e.g., coding solutions) is different from the type of data (discrete answers to questions or verbal responses) that current educational data mining focuses on. This BOF will discuss ways that we might support and better coordinate efforts to build community and capacity among CS Ed researchers, data scientists, and learning scientists toward reducing these barriers. CS Ed infrastructure should support broader re-use of innovative learning content that is instrumented for rich data collection, formats and tools for analysis of learner data, and best practices to make large collections of learner data available to researchers. Achieving these goals requires engaging a large community of researchers to define, develop, and use critical elements of this infrastructure to address specific data-intensive research questions.},

  abstract      = {Despite software engineering's inherently collaborative nature, collaboration with others hasn't been the primary way for students to learn how to program. Although various collaboration frameworks, such as Git, are widely used in software engineering, they've been treated as separate skills to acquire in addition to learning programming languages, rather than ways of learning, working, and thinking while learning to program. One collaborative software development task that students often want to engage in is building websites. However, the complexity of web syntax and architecture has been a hurdle in teaching and learning web design and development, especially for beginners without sufficient technical background. Specifically, syntactic barriers in several different languages for a webpage, inherent coupling of content and design in HTML, difficulty in understanding server-client model, and need for hosting resources for deployment contribute to a steep learning curve in building websites "from scratch". This work aims to address these issues by developing GLIDE (Git-Learning Integrated Development Environment) - a set of tools and curriculum that support in-class collaborative development in web engineering courses. GLIDE structures the website development process as a teacher-guided Git workflow for a team of students collaborating in groups in a Git repository. The application also provides a web programming model that separates content, from design, from implementation, allowing students to take on different roles and responsibilities during the development process. This demo presents a tutorial on how a group of students can build websites collaboratively with teacher's assistance based on the GLIDE software platform and curriculum.},

We explore the approach of embedding a tutoring companion inside Eclipse, a popular IDE. The embedded tutoring companion aims to be comparable to having an actual teaching assistant present all the time with each student throughout a course. The embedded tutoring companion tracks student's actions while solving a problem (coding, compiling, running) and collects metadata including the time spent, the correctness of the work, and the amount of copied or auto-generated code in the work. Then it can determine the practical understanding of the topics and concepts associated with the presented problem, it can assist the student by providing immediate feedback, and it can help instructors by reporting real-time information about students' performance. Our companion, implemented as an Eclipse plug-in, was evaluated with undergraduate students enrolled in a Java programming course.",

However, the abstract nature of programming can make such integration a difficult prospect to achieve. As a result, the main development tool, the Integrated Development Environment, generally takes a passive role during the learning process. These software environments play a pivotal role in the development process and so should perform a more active role in the overall academic process. This paper describes the pronounced D-Chk system, which is an integrated development environment for the Java language. This system allows tighter integration between the theory and the practical aspects by incorporating several user interface and functionality enhancements.}

The 25 students had the choice between asking for feedback on errors in their programs and feedback on possible next steps in the solution process. We hypothesized that learners' choices would depend on correctness of their programs and their progress in problem-solving. Surprisingly, this hypothesis was not confirmed.",
